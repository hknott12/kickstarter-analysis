# Kickstarter-Analysis

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project analyzed data from various Kickstarter fundraising campaigns to help Louise, who is interested in launching her own fundraising project for a play she is working on.  

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to provide Louise with insights about how to successfully launch a fundraising campaign based on data from past fundraising campaigns. To meet this purpose, the data was analyzed by examining the outcomes of campaigns based on launch date and goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first analysis compared outcomes based on launch date. To visually represent this, a line graph was made by grouping month of launch to number of outcomes for successful, failed, or canceled campaigns, represented here: ![theater_outcomes_vs_launch](images/theater_outcomes_vs_launch.png)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The second analysis compared outcomes and goals. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
